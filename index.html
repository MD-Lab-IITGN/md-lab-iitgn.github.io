    <h2>About the Lab</h2>
    <div class="card">
        <p>
            The Biomaterials and Drug Delivery Lab is an integral part of the Biological Engineering Discipline, at IIT Gandhinagar. Working at the interface of medicine, biology, chemical synthesis, and materials science, our highly interdisciplinary and collaborative research focuses on the solving of a wide range of significant medical problems including joint disorders (inflammatory and join-degenerative diseases), GIT disorders, cancer, microbial infections, chronic-diabetic wounds, auto-immune disorders, and allograft-rejections. Our goal at IIT GN is to explore the potential of next-generation biomaterials to develop translational affordable healthcare technologies to address the urgent unmet clinical needs.

<p>The localized/targeted delivery of the therapeutic agents specifically to the disease tissue/cell is the key to improving their efficacy in the body. The application of biomaterials in delivering therapeutics is drastically changing the landscape of biopharmaceutical industry. We are interested in the synthesis and development of novel materials such as nanoparticles, microparticles, hydrogels, prodrugs and composites as promising carrier systems for effective delivery of therapeutics to address the significant clinical problems including joint disorders, GIT related disorders, cancer, allograft-rejections, microbial infections, autoimmune disease, among other.

We are also interested in the development of biocompatible materials with novel properties that can make use of Near infrared (NIR) light to delivery the localized photothermal and photodynamic therapy to kill localized bacterial infections and cancer cells as well.

We are also interested in the development of novel polymeric scaffolds and bio-inks made with natural polymers to provide the targeted drug release and natural tissue regeneration. We have developed some new materials for wound-healing and environmental applications.

Our group (Biomaterials and Drug Delivery Laboratory) utilizes the basic concepts and skill of medicine, synthesis, materials science, and biology to design, develop and validate the novel affordable and sustainable platform technologies to address the health and environment related contemporary issues.<br><b>
Our interdisciplinary and collaborative research focuses on the following topics:</b>
	    <ul>
            <li><h3>Biomaterials Design</h3></li>
            <p>Injectable hydrogels, Novel materials synthesis, Hybrid biomaterials for clinical applications.</p>
            <li><h3>Translatable drug delivery technologies</h3></li>
